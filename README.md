## Instructions

Instructions on how to interact with the work:
- **Click** and **drag** the centre of the mushroom caps to anywhere on the canvas (create your own version of Yayoi Kusama's toadstools!). When you **release** the mouse, there will be a *pop* sound.
- Press the **g** or **G key** to toggle gravity. All the mushrooms will fall towards the bottom of the window, accompanied by a *thud* sound.
- If you try to **click** and **drag** a mushroom, the mushroom will fall back down due to gravity.
- Press the **g** or **G key** again to turn off gravity. You can freeze the mushrooms mid air or rearrange them however you would like.
- Press the **up arrow** for all the mushrooms to float towards the top of the screen. This is accompanied by a light and *glittery* sound effect.

## Individual approach

References to inspiration for animating your individual code; these can be images (still or gifs). How did they influence your submission?

A short technical explanation of how your individual code works to animate the image and any appropriate references.
- If you made a lot of changes to the group code, explain it here.
If you use tools and technique from outside the course, explain why you used them and how they work.
- If you copy a technique from the Internet, explain how it works, why you used it, and where it came from.

This section details my individual approach to animating the group code.

I chose user interaction to drive my individual code. I decided to support this approach with audio to elevate the interaction experience.

From the image that my team and I created, we decided on unique methods to animate the work. Through thorough discussion, we decided on the following:
- Jess (interaction): Allowing the user to move the mushrooms wherever they would like in the window, as well as making the mushrooms fall to the bottom and also float to the top of the window.
- Jen (audio): Changing the size and scale of the mushrooms and patterns, as well as the colour of the triangular background based on the frequency of the audio
- Viko (time): Background lines drawn along paths, and mushrooms bouncing vertically while swaying from side to side.
- Fangxia (perlin noise):
